Issue : App shouldn't be logging in automatically without user's prompt

Steps to Re-produce

2. Register as a new user
            (OR)
    Login with the below credentials
        email : test1@test.com
        password : Test@123
3. Now uninstall and install the app
            (OR)
   Clear the app's data
4. Open the app and click on Login Button


Now the user is signed in automatically without prompting him for the credentials.
